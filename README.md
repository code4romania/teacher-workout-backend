**Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-backend/wiki)!**

Teacher Workout [was prototyped](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/teacher-workout) in [Civic Labs](https://civiclabs.ro/ro), the research and prototyping program in [Code for Romania](https://code4.ro/ro). 

Teacher Workout is an application meant to deliver shot, interactive lessons. The themes of these lessons include identifying children who manifest a difficulty in learning, handling difficult classrooms situations, integrating children with particular needs in a classroom. These micro-courses are meant to help foster positive habits for teachers and professors alike. 

The Teacher Workout ecosystem is composed of:

* [the backend](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-backend)
* [the web app](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-client)
* the two mobile apps, [one for Android](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-android) and [another one for iOS](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-ios)

The Teacher Workout prototype and UI is available [in the Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/uLiqrlxmOB5xCppIzmiUXV/Teacher-Workout?node-id=0%3A1).
