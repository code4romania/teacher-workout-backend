**Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-backend/wiki)!**

Teacher Workout [was prototyped](https://civiclabs.ro/ro/solutions/teacher-workout) in [Civic Labs](https://civiclabs.ro/ro), the research and prototyping program in [Code for Romania](https://code4.ro/ro).

Teacher Workout is an application meant to deliver shot, interactive lessons. The themes of these lessons include identifying children who manifest a difficulty in learning, handling difficult classrooms situations, integrating children with particular needs in a classroom. These micro-courses are meant to help foster positive habits for teachers and professors alike.

The Teacher Workout ecosystem is composed of:

* [the backend](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-backend)
* [the web app](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-client)
* the two mobile apps, [one for Android](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-android) and [another one for iOS](https://github.com/code4romania/teacher-workout-ios)

The Teacher Workout prototype and UI is available [in the Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/uLiqrlxmOB5xCppIzmiUXV/Teacher-Workout?node-id=0%3A1).

Help us out by testing this project in the [staging environment](https://teacher.heroesof.tech/ui/graphiql). You can use a GraphQL client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
If you see something that doesn't quite work the way you expect it to, open an Issue. Make sure to describe what you _expect to happen_ and _what is actually happening_ in detail.

If you would like to suggest new functionality, open an Issue and mark it as a __[Feature request]__. Please be specific about why you think this functionality will be of use. If you can, please include some visual description of what you would like the UI to look like, if you are suggesting new UI elements.

## Set Up
### Install Dependencies

- docker-compose >= v1.26.2
- docker >= v20.10.7

### Start DB server
```
docker-compose up # and stop
docker start teacher_workout_db
```
TODO: decouple docker-compose in development from staging 

### Run migrations
```
dotnet ef database update --startup-project TeacherWorkout.Api/ --project TeacherWorkout.Data/
```

### Start App
```
dotnet run -p TeacherWorkout.Api
```

## FAQ

### Add a migration
```
dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationNameGoesHere> --startup-project TeacherWorkout.Api/ --project TeacherWorkout.Data/
```

### Run tests
```
ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Test dotnet test
```

### Apply migrations and seed data to your dev DB
Migrations will be applyed using the Migrator in all environments when running the application with docker.

If dummy data is needed for development purposes just set the *SEEDDATA* to true in the .env file when runngin locally using docker. This will populate the DB with some dummy data on the first run. Subsequent runs will not re-seed if the data is already present.
```
SEEDDATA=true
```
Alternatively, you can run the following commands to only run the Migrator in your local environment as needed. 
```
cd TeacherWorkout.Migrator
dotnet run SeedData=false
```

## Deployment
Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1. Installation process
2. Software dependencies
3. Latest releases
4. API references

Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.
